<p>Programmers often utilize various symbols that are encoded with multiple characters. To the human brain, sequences such as <code>-&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, or <code>:=</code> are seen as single logical tokens, despite taking up two or three characters on the screen. Your eyes expend effort scanning, parsing, and merging these characters into one logical unit. Ideally, all programming languages would feature fully developed Unicode symbols for operators, but this is not yet a universal practice.</p>
<p>Lilex is an extension of the IBM Plex Mono font, incorporating a range of ligatures for common multi-character sequences in programming. This is purely a font rendering feature: the underlying code remains compatible with ASCII. This improvement aids in reading and understanding code more swiftly. For frequent sequences such as <code>..</code> or <code>//</code>, ligatures adjust spacing appropriately.</p>
